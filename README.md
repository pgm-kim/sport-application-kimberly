# Sport application

## Introduction
Welcome to this sport application project! In this project I developed a responsive web application with Eleventy and Sass.

## Installation
Move to the root of this project and install node_modules.
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
In the root of this project, open your terminal and type this:
```bash
npm run start
```
After you started the server you can go to this link: http://localhost:8080/start/index.html and start using the application.

## General purpose
In Part 1 of the final assignment, I started from an idea and develop it into an attractive and user-friendly design. In this second part, I developed my unique design with the Static Site Generator called Eleventy.

The goal of this assignment is as follows:

- Being able to start up a development environment independently
- Learning to develop according to the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- BEM as style naming
- Styles structured with SCSS
- Recognise and implement Layouts and Templates
- Creating components where necessary
- Deploying a static website via Git
